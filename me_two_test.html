    <h2>My Favorite Vacation</h2>
    <p>
        This past summer, my family and I went to Maui, as we have done every summer since I was 12. It is my favorite place in the world to be, and I hope to be able to keep the tradition alive, remaining loyal to Maui every summer for the rest of my life!
	As cheesy as it sounds, it was a trip full of happiness, including walking on our favorite coastal trails, feeling the sunshine soak into our skin, one incident involving my Mom sitting in dog poop on the beach, and spotting turtles swimming every morning. 
	I can hear the birds chirping there now!
    </p>

    <h2>My Favorite Names for Pets</h2>
    <ul>
	<li>A dog named Moxie, specifically a havanese bichon mix</li>
	<li>A dog named Mango, specifically a shih tzu maltese mix</li>
	<li>A dog named Oscar Mayer Wiener Casey, specifically a wiener dog</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Favorite Restaurant</h2>
    <p>
	From the time I was about 16 or 17 to 20 years old, my Mom and I had a highly esteemed and cherished Sunday night tradition of going to Ramen Man. It was a tiny, borderline dirty, hole-in-the-wall spot on 45th in Seattle, and yet, nothing was more delicious than their shoyu ramen with egg noodles, a side of rice, gyoza, and two cans of coke, our go to order each and every Sunday night.
 	Sadly, Ramen Man closed during covid and its tiny, barely clean, hole-in-the-wall location has now been replaced with something new. But every time I drive down 45th, I can picture my Mom and I in their tiny basement seating area and all of our memories there. So, even though it no longer exists, Ramen Man will always be my favorite restaurant!

	These are my grandma's rolls. Nothing, and I mean <i>nothing</i>, is more delicious than them! The recipe, passed down from her mom, is framed on the wall of her kitchen. If they're made by someone other than my grandma or so much as a different butter is used, 
	you can tell! They are made every Thanksgiving and Christmas without fail. Growing up, my sister and I would spend the night before Thanksgiving and also Christmas Eve at our grandparents and help our Grandma make the rolls, something we always treasured.
