	<h3>My Summer Vacation</h3>
	<p>This summer my family and I went to Maui. We have gone every summer since I was 12 and it is my favorite place in the world to be. It sounds cheesy, but it was a trip full of walking on our favorite trails by the ocean, sunshine, happiness, and spotting turtles every morning. I can hear the birds chirping there now!</p>
	<h3>My Favorite Names for Pets</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A dog named Moxie, specifically a havanese bichon mix</li>
		<li>A rabbit named Ruby</li>
		<li>A dog named Dottie, specifically a dalmatian</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>My Favorite Restaurant</h2>
	<p>
		I love Ramen Man with my entire heart. Every single Sunday night from when I was about 16 or 17 to 20 years old, my Mom and I would go to Ramen Man. It was our Sunday night tradition. Ramen Man was a little tiny hole in the wall on 45th in Seattle, barely clean, but there was nothing more delicious than their shoyu ramen with egg noodles, a side of rice, gyoza and 2 cokes, which was exactly my Mom and I's very loyal order. They closed during Covid which I consider a big tragedy and have no indications that they will ever reopen and their barely clean, hole in the wall location has now been replaced with something else. But every time I drive by it on 45th, I can picture being inside with my Mom and all of our memories there. So, even though it no longer exists, Ramen Man will always be my favorite restaurant.
