	<h3>My Summer Vacation</h3>
	<p>This summer my family and I went to Maui. We have gone every summer since I was 12 and it is my favorite place in the world to be. It sounds cheesy, but it was a trip full of walking on our favorite trails by the ocean, sunshine, happiness, and spotting turtles every morning. I can hear the birds chirping there now!</p>
	<h3>My Favorite Names for Pets</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A dog named Moxie, specifically a havanese bichon mix</li>
		<li>A rabbit named Ruby</li>
		<li>A dog named Dottie, specifically a dalmatian</li>
	</ul>
