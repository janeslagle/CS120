	<h2>My Summer Vacation</h2>
	<p>This summer my family and I went to Maui. We have gone every summer since I was 12 and it is my favorite place in the world to be. It sounds cheesy, but it was a trip full of walking on our favorite trails by the ocean, sunshine, happiness, and spotting turtles every morning. I can hear the birds chirping there now!</p>
