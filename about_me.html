	<h2>My Summer Vacation</h2>
	<p>This summer my family and I went to Maui. We have gone every summer since I was 12 and it is my favorite place in the world to be. It sounds cheesy, but it was a trip full of walking on our favorite trails by the ocean, sunshine, happiness, and spotting turtles every morning. I can hear the birds chirping there now!</p>
	
	<h2>My Favorite Names for Pets</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>A dog named Moxie, specifically a havanese bichon mix</li>
		<li>A rabbit named Ruby</li>
		<li>A dog named Dottie, specifically a dalmatian</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>My Favorite Restaurant</h2>
	<p>
		I love Ramen Man with my entire heart. Every single Sunday night from when I was about 16 or 17 to 20 years old, my Mom and I would go to Ramen Man. It was our Sunday night tradition. Ramen Man was a little tiny hole in the wall on 45th in Seattle, barely clean, but there was nothing more delicious than their shoyu ramen with egg noodles, a side of rice, gyoza and 2 cokes, which was exactly my Mom and I's very loyal order. They closed during Covid which I consider a big tragedy and have no indications that they will ever reopen and their barely clean, hole in the wall location has now been replaced with something else. But every time I drive by it on 45th, I can picture being inside with my Mom and all of our memories there. So, even though it no longer exists, Ramen Man will always be my favorite restaurant.

	<h2>My Favorite Food</h2>
	<p>
		These are my grandma's rolls. Nothing, and I mean nothing, is more delicious than them. It is a recipe from her mom that she has framed on the wall in her kitchen. If anyone else tries to make them, you can tell. If you try to make them in a kitchen that isn't my Grandma's, you can tell. If you so much as use a different brand of butter, you can tell. They are made every Thanksgiving and every Christmas without fail, and sometimes for birthdays with cinnamon on them. My favorite way to eat them though is just by themselves, they are that delicious!
